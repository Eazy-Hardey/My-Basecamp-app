# Welcome to My Basecamp 1
***
## Task
The problem was creating my_basecamp with the following features: User Registration: User #new: Create a new user.User #show: Display user information.User #create: Save new user to the database.User #destroy: Delete a user.
In  a nutshell, you should be able to create a new user, delete a user, and as a new user, create an account yourself.
Session - User #sign_in: Log in as a user.
User #sign_out: Log out as a user.
Role Permission ---- User setAdmin -User #setAdmin: Grant admin permissions to a user. and aswell User #removeAdmin: Remove admin permissions from a user.
This means you will have two types of permissions, someone who is a user, and someone who is a user and an admin. We want the ability to also remove the admin permission from a user.
Project - Project #new - Project #show - Project #edit - Project #destroy
Similar to the real Basecamp, users should be able to create, edit, and destroy a project.
## Description
What is basecamp?
Basecamp is a web-based project management tool launched in 2004. Its primary features include to-do lists, milestone management, forum-like messaging, file sharing, and time tracking.
In this project, you'll create a website that mimics features from the original Basecamp tool. This will involve creating a database, backend, and frontend to allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage projects.
